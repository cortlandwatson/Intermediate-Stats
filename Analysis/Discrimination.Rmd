#### Background

Sometime around 1965 a survey was conducted where students at a certain university were asked the following question. "Do you think that some racial and religious groups should be prevented from living in certain sections of cities?" A summary of their response are recorded in the following table. The region of the United States that the student respondent was from was also recorded.

<div style="padding-left:20%; padding-right:20%;">

| Region | *Agree* | *Undecided* | *Disagree* |
|--------|---------|-------------|------------|
| East   |  89     |  79         |  297       |
| Midwest| 118     | 130         |  350       |
| South  | 241     | 140         |  248       |
| West   |  37     |  59         |  197       |

</div>

```{r}
discrim <- matrix(c(89,79,297,118,130,350,241,140,248,37,59,197), ncol = 3, byrow = T)
colnames(discrim) <- c("Agree","Undecided","Disagree")
rownames(discrim) <- c("East","Midwest","South","West")
